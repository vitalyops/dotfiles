## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

__Disclaimer:__ _Oh My Zsh works best on macOS and Linux._

* `git` should be installed

### Basic Installation

Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.

#### via curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### via wget

```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### Manual inspection

It's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you don't yet know. You can do
that by downloading the install script first, looking through it so everything looks normal,
then running it:

```shell
curl -Lo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh
sh install.sh
```
